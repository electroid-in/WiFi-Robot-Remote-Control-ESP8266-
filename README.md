# WiFi-Robot-Remote-Control-ESP8266-
 This project allows you to control a 2WD robot using an ESP8266 board (NodeMCU) via WiFi. It supports both **STA mode** (connect to your router) and **AP mode** (robot creates its own hotspot). You can control the robot through a web interface with buttons for Forward, Backward, Left, Right, and Stop.
